# Data directory

This directory organizes datasets and artifacts by pipeline stage.

**Stage convention**
- `a_raw/`        Original raw files (as obtained from sources). May be incomplete in the public repo.
- `b_extracted/`  Parsed/standardized exports from raw sources (light cleaning, consistent columns).
- `c_interim/`    Dataset-specific cleaned tables used as inputs to the final merge steps.
- `d_processed/`  Final, canonical tables used by scripts/figures/models (model-ready).

## Key contents

### `reference/`
Manually curated reference tables used for name/identifier harmonization and preprocessing (e.g., drug lists, synonym tables). These are treated as **inputs**.

### `features/`
Final feature matrices used in modeling (e.g., Chemical Checker concatenations, strain-space embeddings). These are produced by `feature_pipeline/`.

## Notes
- Intermediate and processed outputs are generated by notebooks/scripts in `notebooks/` and `feature_pipeline/`.
- Do not edit `d_processed/` outputs manually; regenerate them from the pipeline if changes are needed.
