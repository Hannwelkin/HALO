	abstract = {Antibiotics are among the most important discoveries of the 20th century, having saved millions of lives from infectious diseases. Microbes have developed acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to many drugs due to high selection pressure from increasing use and misuse of antibiotics over the years. The transmission and acquisition of AMR occur primarily via a human–human interface both within and outside of healthcare facilities. A huge number of interdependent factors related to healthcare and agriculture govern the development of AMR through various drug-resistance mechanisms. The emergence and spread of AMR from the unrestricted use of antimicrobials in livestock feed has been a major contributing factor. The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria has attained an incongruous level worldwide and threatens global public health as a silent pandemic, necessitating urgent intervention. Therapeutic options of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are limited, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality with high financial impact. The paucity in discovery and supply of new novel antimicrobials to treat life-threatening infections by resistant pathogens stands in sharp contrast to demand. Immediate interventions to contain AMR include surveillance and monitoring, minimizing over-the-counter antibiotics and antibiotics in food animals, access to quality and affordable medicines, vaccines and diagnostics, and enforcement of legislation. An orchestrated collaborative action within and between multiple national and international organizations is required urgently, otherwise, a postantibiotic era can be a more real possibility than an apocalyptic fantasy for the 21st century. This narrative review highlights on this basis, mechanisms and factors in microbial resistance, and key strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.},

Addressing antimicrobial resistance requires a comprehensive response, including infection prevention efforts, surveillance, stewardship, therapy appropriateness and access, and research and development. However, antimicrobial research and development is limited and lags behind the output of other fields, such as that of cancer or HIV research. The 2023 WHO analysis of the global antibacterial clinical pipeline serves as a tool to monitor and guide research and development efforts. The analysis emphasises the remaining gaps in developing a robust and effective antibacterial drug pipeline, drawing insights from trend analyses and assessment of the innovation potential of candidate antimicrobials. In the present analysis, we evaluated the activity of antibiotics against the new WHO bacterial priority pathogens list 2024, which reflects changing trends in resistance patterns, distribution of bacterial infections, and the emergence of new resistance mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The field of synergistic combinations of antibiotics is extremely broad and mostly has been explored in vitro. Some fixed combinations were successfully developed commercially. A few combinations were tested in animal models, and a smaller number was studied in human patients. Any practitioner in infectious diseases has some individual cases, published or unpublished, which add some evidence to the role of synergistic combinations in difficult therapy problems--either on the side of the patient when immunosuppressed or on the side of the bacterial strain, when multiply resistant. MRSA, VISA, E. faecium resistant to penicillin G and highly resistant to aminoglysocides and to vancomycin, P. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and imipenem, and Acinetobacter baumani resistant to imipenem are some of the bacterial strains dangerous for the patient and the hospital, which trigger the imagination of the microbiologist and physician to find a satisfactory treatment. On the side of the drug industry, the increasing knowledge of resistance mechanisms and of synergistic mechanisms may open some new approach, such as efflux inhibitors, a membrane-active compound that can be combined with a partner antibiotic. Antagonism between antibiotics would be worthwhile to study because it likely contributes to the disadvantages of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial combinations.},

	abstract = {In most cases antimicrobial combinations are employed to broaden the spectrum of coverage. This clinical application is likely to be successful as long as the combinations are not antagonistic. Most examples of antibiotic antagonism are those in which a bacteriostatic agent renders a bactericidal agent "static." Another type of antagonism occurs when cefoxitin (which has a propensity to induce beta-lactamase production) is combined with another beta-lactam antibiotic. Combination drug therapy prevents emergence of resistant strains in mycobacterial infections and in infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci and certain other resistant organisms. Synergistic combinations should allow the use of lower concentrations of drugs in combination and thus diminish the incidence of dose-related antibiotic toxicity, but the concept has met with only limited success so far. Three types of antimicrobial combination or interaction result in enhanced (synergistic) antimicrobial activity. These types include combinations of agents that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis with aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols, the use of beta-lactamase inhibitors in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics, and the administration of agents that act on sequential steps in one of the bacterial metabolic or synthetic pathways. Combinations of two beta-lactam antibiotics that bind to complementary penicillin-binding proteins may represent an analogous situation. Amdinocillin binds specifically to penicillin-binding protein 2, and in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated synergism when amdinocillin is combined with other penicillins and cephalosporins that have higher affinity for other penicillin-binding proteins.},

We profiled {\textasciitilde}8,000 combinations of 65 antibacterial drugs against the model species Bacillus subtilis and two prominent pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thereby, we recapitulated previously known drug interactions, but also identified ten times more novel interactions in the pathogen S. aureus, including 150 synergies. We showed that two synergies were equally effective against multidrug-resistant S. aureus clinical isolates in vitro and in vivo. Interactions were largely species-specific and synergies were distinct from those of Gram-negative species, owing to cell surface and drug uptake differences. We also tested 2,728 combinations of 44 commonly prescribed non-antibiotic drugs with 62 drugs with antibacterial activity against S. aureus and identified numerous antagonisms that might compromise the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies. We identified even more synergies and showed that the anti-aggregant ticagrelor synergized with cationic antibiotics by modifying the surface charge of S. aureus.

We experimentally measured the interaction of 123 new drug pairs, as a prospective validation set for our approach, and identified 37 new synergistic pairs. Of the 12 pairs predicted to be synergistic, 10 were experimentally validated, corresponding to a 2.8-fold enrichment. Having thus validated our methodology, we produced a compendium of interaction predictions for all pairwise combinations among 100 antibiotics.

In this model, a network proximity method combined with network propagation was used to quantify the relationships of drug pairs and we found that synergistic antibiotic combinations tend to have smaller network proximity. Therefore, network proximity can be used for building affinity matrix. Subsequently, the affinity matrix was fed into a graph regularization model to predict potential synergistic antibiotic combinations.

	abstract = {Non-optimized pharmacokinetic parameters serve as the primary cause of failure in clinical trials of drugs. Therefore, the successful prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters during the pre-clinical stage is crucial for the success of drug candidates. Conventional methods primarily rely on 2D structural information, while advanced models extend the features to other structural-related information or use advanced computational models to improve prediction accuracy. However, to gain a comprehensive understanding of small molecules, integrating bioactivity profiles with chemical structural information is essential. One significant challenge in this integration is the high proportion of missing values within experimentally validated bioactivity profiles for most small molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce Bio-Mol, an artificial intelligence model designed to effectively handle this issue. Bio-Mol utilizes a pretrain and finetune strategy, enabling the incorporation of a large proportion of missing bioactivity profiles during the small molecule representation learning process.
Comprehensive evaluations of Bio-Mol demonstrate a notable improvement in predicting molecule properties. The integration of missing bioactivity profiles enhances the AUROC of average 5.2\% compared to the previous state-of-the-art model’s predictions. Furthermore, we explore the potential of Bio-Mol in predicting synergistic drug combinations, highlighting its versatility and broader applications in the field of drug discovery.
The successful implementation of Bio-Mol showcases its efficacy in over-coming the challenges posed by missing bioactivity profile data. This model paves the way for optimizing small molecule pharmacokinetics prediction, providing valuable insights for drug development and discovery processes.},

Results Here, we present a viral-host Metabolic Modeling (vhMM) method to systematically evaluate the disturbances in host metabolism in viral infection and computationally identify targets for modulation by integrating genome-wide precision metabolic modeling and cheminformatics. We applied vhMM to SARS-CoV-2 infections and identified consistent changes in host metabolism and gene and endogenous metabolite targets between the original SARS-COV-2 and different variants (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron). Among six compounds predicted for repurposing, methotrexate, cinnamaldehyde, and deferiprone were tested in vitro and effective in inhibiting viral production with IC50 less than 4uM. Further, an analysis of real-world patient data showed that cinnamon usage significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate with an odds ratio of 0.65 [95\%CI: 0.55∼0.75].
Conclusions These results demonstrated that vhMM is an efficient method for predicting targets and drugs for viral infections.},

	abstract = {More sophisticated representations of compounds attempt to incorporate not only information on the structure and physicochemical properties of molecules, but also knowledge about their biological traits, leading to the so-called bioactivity profile. The bioactive profiling of air pollutants is challenging and crucial, as their biological activity and toxicological effects have not been deeply investigated yet, and further exploration could shed light on the impact of air pollution on complex disorders. Therefore, a biological signature that simultaneously captures the chemistry and the biology of small molecules may be beneficial in predicting the behaviour of such ligands towards a protein target. Moreover, the interactivity between biological entities can be represented through combined feature vectors that can be given as input to a machine learning (ML) model to capture the underlying interaction. To this end, we propose a chemogenomic approach, called Air Pollutant Bioactivity (APBIO), which integrates compound bioactivity signatures and target sequence descriptors to train ML classifiers subsequently used to predict potential compound-target interactions (CTIs). We report the performances of the proposed methodology and, via external validation sets, demonstrate its outperformance compared to existing molecular representations in terms of model generalizability. We have also developed a publicly available Streamlit application for APBIO at ap-bio.streamlit.app, allowing users to predict associations between investigated compounds and protein targets.},

Although some drug combinations are being used, their underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Therefore, it is of great interest to deduce a novel drug combination by their molecular mechanisms in a robust and rigorous way. This paper attempts to predict effective drug combinations by a combined consideration of: (1) chemical interaction between drugs, (2) protein interactions between drugs' targets, and (3) target enrichment of KEGG pathways. A benchmark dataset was constructed, consisting of 121 confirmed effective combinations and 605 random combinations. Each drug combination was represented by 465 features derived from the aforementioned three properties. Some feature selection techniques, including Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance and Incremental Feature Selection, were adopted to extract the key features. Random forest model was built with its performance evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation. As a result, 55 key features providing the best prediction result were selected. These important features may help to gain insights into the mechanisms of drug combinations, and the proposed prediction model could become a useful tool for screening possible drug combinations.},

	abstract = {Efforts to construct therapeutically useful models of biological systems require large and diverse sets of data on functional connections between their components. Here we show that cellular responses to combinations of chemicals reveal how their biological targets are connected. Simulations of pathways with pairs of inhibitors at varying doses predict distinct response surface shapes that are reproduced in a yeast experiment, with further support from a larger screen using human tumour cells. The response morphology yields detailed connectivity constraints between nearby targets, and synergy profiles across many combinations show relatedness between targets in the whole network. Constraints from chemical combinations complement genetic studies, because they probe different cellular components and can be applied to disease models that are not amenable to mutagenesis. Chemical probes also offer increased flexibility, as they can be continuously dosed, temporally controlled, and readily combined. After extending this initial study to cover a wider range of combination effects and pathway topologies, chemical combinations may be used to refine network models or to identify novel targets. This response surface methodology may even apply to non‐biological systems where responses to targeted perturbations can be measured.},

Bacteriol. 87:1044–1050. 1964.—Penicillin and cycloserine do not inhibit the growth of protoplasts of Bacillus megaterium, indicating that inhibition of cell-wall synthesis is the only significant process by which they inhibit growth of bacteria. In contrast, bacitracin and vancomycin inhibit growth of protoplasts and bacteria at similar concentrations, indicating that they have important sites of action other than their known inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. At concentrations which inhibit mucopeptide synthesis, penicillin, bacitracin, and vancomycin each cause an increased rate of efflux of K ions from growing bacteria. This effect of penicillin is prevented by chloramphenicol or hypertonic sucrose, whereas the effects of bacitracin and vancomycin are unchanged under these conditions. It is concluded that bacitracin and vancomycin have direct effects on the cytoplasmic membrane, and it is proposed that their inhibition of cell-wall synthesis could be a consequence of these effects. Bacitracin and vancomycin do not compete with penicillin for binding to cells of B. megaterium, a further indication that they have a different primary site of action.},

One way to curb the development of antibiotic resistance is to design drug combinations where the development of resistance against one drug leads to collateral sensitivity to the other drug. Here we study collateral sensitivity patterns of the globally distributed extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase CTX-M-15, and find three non-synonymous mutations with increased resistance against mecillinam or piperacillin–tazobactam that simultaneously confer full susceptibility to several cephalosporin drugs. We show in vitro and in mice that a combination of mecillinam and cefotaxime eliminates both wild-type and resistant CTX-M-15. Our results indicate that mecillinam and cefotaxime in combination constrain resistance evolution of CTX-M-15, and illustrate how drug combinations can be rationally designed to limit the resistance evolution of horizontally transferred genes by exploiting collateral sensitivity patterns.},

If a non-toxic combination such as cefuroxime and ticarcillin could act synergistically to lower bactericidal concentrations these drugs could have a wide clinical application. Six strains of Providencia stuarti were isolated from paraplegics with urinary tract infection. When tested separately the MICs and MBCs of cefuroxime were 64 and 512mg/l respectively, and of ticarcillin 2 and 512mg/l. However, the organisms were inhibited by cefuroxime 1mg/l with ticarcillin 4 mg/1. and killed by cefuroxime 2 mg/1 and ticarcillin 4mg/l. The patients were treated intramuscularly with ticarcillin 1.5 g b.d. and cefuroxime 750 mg in the morning. and 1 1/2 h after the morning combination the serum was bactericidal to the Providencia at dilutions of 1 in 4 to 1 in 16, and the organisms were eradicated. Cefuroxime and ticarcillin have been found to act synergistically also against some strains of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Strep. faecalis. The MIC of cefuroxime for Strep. faecalis can be mis-read if the inoculum is too small. Repeated studies showed that in 50 isolates of Strep. faecalis the MIC of cefuroxime was 256mg/l for 12 strains, 512mg/l for another 31 strains, and 1024mg/l for the other 5 strains. Although 87 of 100 strains of Strep. faecalis were inhibited by ticarcillin 32mg/l, the MBC was usually 512mg/l. At a concentration of cefuroxime of 16mg/l none of 300 strains of E. coli were resistant to cefuroxime. and of 132 strains of Klebsiella only 3 were resistant, whereas 6 were resistant to cefoxitin. Of 56 strains of Enterobacter 47 were sensitive to cefuroxime but only 6 to cefoxitin. Cefuroxime is also more active than cefoxitin against Acinetobacter, 15 of 27 strains being sensitive, but is less active than cefoxitin against indole-positive Proteus species, Citrobacter and Serratia.},

The antimicrobial capacity of four compounds of plant origin (thymol and gallic, salicylic and gentisic acids) was analysed against 14 pathogenic bacteria. Thymol showed the best antimicrobial activity, with MICs ranging from 125 µg/mL (for Acinetobacter baumannii, Pasteurella aerogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium) to 250 µg/mL (for Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). Combinations of thymol with eight widely used antibiotics were studied to identify combinations with synergistic effects. Thymol showed synergistic activity with chloramphenicol against A. baumannii (critical priority by the WHO), with streptomycin and gentamicin against Staphylococcus aureus (high priority by the WHO), and with streptomycin against Streptococcus agalactiae, decreasing the MICs of these antibiotics by 75\% to 87.5\%. The kinetics of these synergies indicated that thymol alone at the synergy concentration had almost no effect on the maximum achievable population density and very little effect on the growth rate. However, in combination with antibiotics at the same concentration, it completely inhibited growth, confirming its role in facilitating the action of the antibiotic. The time–kill curves indicated that all the combinations with synergistic effects were mainly bactericidal.},

This study’s objective was to provide clinical translation to these experimental data and determine if DAP+BL combination therapy results in improved clinical outcomes compared with treatment with DAP alone in patients with MRSA bloodstream infections (BSIs).This was a retrospective, comparative cohort study conducted at 2 academic medical centers between 2008 and 2018. Adults with MRSA BSI treated with DAP for ≥72 hours and initiated ≤5 days of culture collection were included. Patients who received a BL for ≥24 hours and initiated ≤24 hours of DAP comprised the DAP+BL group. The primary outcome was composite clinical failure (60-day all-cause mortality and/or 60-day recurrence). Analyses were adjusted for confounding using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).A total of 229 patients were included (72 DAP+BL and 157 DAP). In unadjusted and IPTW-adjusted analyses, DAP+BL was associated with significantly reduced odds of clinical failure (odds ratio [OR], 0.362; 95\% confidence interval [CI], .164–.801; adjusted OR, 0.386; 95\% CI, .175–.853). Adjusted analyses restricted to prespecified subgroups based on infection complexity and baseline health status were consistent with the main analysis.The addition of a BL to DAP was associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with MRSA BSI. This study provides support to ongoing and future studies evaluating the impact of combination therapy for invasive MRSA infections.Patients treated with daptomycin plus a $\beta$-lactam for MRSA bloodstream infection had lower odds of composite clinical failure defined as 60-day all-cause mortality and/or 60-day recurrence compared with patients treated with daptomycin monotherapy after adjusting for confounding variables using inverse probability of treatment weighting.},

	abstract = {Chemical signatures encode the physicochemical and structural properties of small molecules into numerical descriptors, forming the basis for chemical comparisons and search algorithms. The increasing availability of bioactivity data has improved compound representations to include biological effects (for example, induced gene expression changes), although bioactivity descriptors are often limited to a few well-documented molecules. To address this issue, we implemented a collection of deep neural networks able to leverage the experimentally determined bioactivity data associated to small molecules and infer the missing bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest. However, unlike static chemical descriptors, these bioactivity signatures dynamically evolve with new data and processing strategies. Here we present a computational protocol to modify or generate novel bioactivity spaces and signatures, describing the main steps needed to leverage diverse bioactivity data with the current knowledge, as catalogued in the Chemical Checker (CC; https://chemicalchecker.org/ ), using the predefined data curation pipeline. We illustrate the functioning of the protocol through four specific examples, including the incorporation of new compounds to an already existing bioactivity space, a change in the data preprocessing without altering the underlying experimental data and the creation of two novel bioactivity spaces from scratch, which are completed in under 9 h using graphics processing unit computing. Overall, this protocol offers a guideline for installing, testing and running the CC data integration approach on user-provided data, extending the annotation presented for a limited number of small molecules to a larger chemical landscape and generating novel bioactivity signatures.},
